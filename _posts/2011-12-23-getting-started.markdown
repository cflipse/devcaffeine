It's been a long time since I tried to regularly maintain a blog; I once had 
a wordpress blog under the same name, but it suffered from the bitrot that hits
a lot of neglected self-hosted wordpress installs.

Rather than apologize for not posting and trying to get that old beast into
shape, I'm starting from scratch here. Compared to the various social media
sites out there, _starting_ a blog in this day and age seems odd.  For the most
part though, I want to talk about and explore some technical ideas in deeper
depth.  I'll see how well I can keep this up, this time through.

I've been doing software professionally for a decade now.  Most of that time,
I've been embedded in an environment that doesn't much promote oversharing.
About two weeks ago, however, I started as a developer at [Living
Social](http://livingsocial.com/).  I'll be working on improving their
internal tools and services.  Some of it will be green field, and some of it
will be rescuing older applications.

I'm not the only one talking about the things I'm planning on starting with
here; I'm far from a primary source.  What I am is an aggressive early
adopter ... and a cranky old-school UNIX curmugeon and VI holy warrior.

It's probably not wise to start working on a blog before heading off on
holiday vacation, but I wanted to get at least a little something in place.
There are a couple of things I'm going to write about sometime in January, and
I wanted to get the baseline established.  For now, I have _got_ to finish
packing.
